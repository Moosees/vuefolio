# vuefolio

## Project description

This is a portfolio webapp for me, Linus. It's build with Vue on a Vite setup with vue-router and pinia. The backgrounds are made with SDXL 1.0 and edited with GIMP.

## Running the app locally

clone the project from this repository (or download it manually) then run:

```sh
npm install
npm run dev
```
